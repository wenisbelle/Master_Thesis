WORKERS ORCHESTRATOR
--------------------
Trainer-side handle for a pool of worker processes.

Lifecycle in sync mode:
    1. __init__   -> spawn workers 
    2. set_weights(state_dict)
    3. broadcast()
    4. resume()                     # workers wake up and start collecting
    5. collect(min_new_transitions) # blocks until threshold; sends PAUSE at end
    6. ... train ...
    7. set_weights + broadcast + resume   (back to step 5)

Lifecycle in async mode:
    No PAUSE / CONTINUE — workers free-run from the moment they receive their
    first weight broadcast. The trainer drains transitions opportunistically.
